## Final Analysis

After reviewing the data set for this assignment, I have made the following observations:

* Reading scores were roughly the same between charter and public schools, but math scores differed on avergae by 4% with charter schools at 66% and public schools at 62%.

* 9th grade public schools had the highest budget of all schools in the dataset. 

* Despite high funding, 9th grade public schools had some of the lowest math scores at 63%.
